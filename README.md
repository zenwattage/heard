A Cli brain dumping tool.

# Inspiration
When working in restaurants/bars/kitchens it's common to be holding many tasks in your working memory as you are
taking order/request from customers and relaying these orders/requests to coworkers.

It is obviously better if the orders/requests are written down as they are received but often hands are full and they are unable to quickly jot down the order. So verbally relaying the request is the solution to prevent working memory from becoming overloaded and orders/requests being lost and customers being made unhappy. 

A verbal confirmation that is widespread is the phrase, "heard." For example, a server might tell the bartender, "I need a margarita for table 12." The bartender would respond with, "Heard." Indicating that he/she heard the request. Nothing further is needed. The order has been relayed and heard and will be created.

In this style I want to pass things in my brain to my 'coworker' have them 'heard' it and handle it appropriately.

My intention is to use this project, to learn, but also to start the habit of looking for areas where I can build myself tools to simplify my life.
